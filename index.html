                <p class="container__squadText">
                    In Pep Guardiola’s first season in charge of Barcelona, they claimed a treble by winning La Liga, the Copa del
                    Rey and the UEFA Champions League. What separates them from many others is the style they played in. At their
                    best, this was as close to footballing utopia as possible. Guardiola came in and did a superb job, selling key
                    players such as Deco and Ronaldinho whilst signing players like Dani Alves and Gerard Pique. The trio of Lionel
                    Messi, Samuel Eto’o and Thierry Henry were clinical, netting one 100 goals between them across the season.

                    Tactically, Barcelona stuck with the 4-3-3 formation throughout the season. Playing with a very high-line in
                    defense, they played very high up the pitch. The team was superb with its pressing, as they pressed in a
                    harassing-like manner when they lost the ball. The pressing started very high up the pitch, and with multiple
                    players closing down the ball when out of possession, they won the ball back very effectively. Another key idea
                    is the positioning of the fullbacks. Alves played much higher up the pitch than Eric Abidal on the opposite
                    side. Alves provided width down the right, which allowed Messi to cut inside onto his favored left foot from his
                    right-wing position. Henry, on the left, played more like a natural winger, staying wider than Messi. Yaya Toure
                    played deepest in midfield, acting as a defensive shield for the center-backs. This is particularly interesting
                    due to his effectiveness at Manchester City playing in a box-to-box role and scoring goals from midfield. Here,
                    he played a disciplined role in midfield. For example, when both Abidal and Alves pushed forward, Toure dropped
                    into defense as a third center-back. Xavi Hernandez played as a metronome and Andres Iniesta played the furthest
                    forward in the midfield trio. There were some variations to the system, but not many. With Messi’s superb goal
                    output, he was given a chance later into the season to play in the center. In this 4-3-1-2 formation, Messi
                    played as the “False 9”with Henry and Eto’o taking up the left and right wing positions respectively.

                    Admittedly, Barcelona were lucky to win the Champions League. In the semi-final second leg against Chelsea,
                    Barcelona were fortunate to progress with a late goal from Iniesta, after Chelsea were denied several penalties.
                    On the other hand, Abidal was wrongly sent-off in that match and Barcelona’s performance in the final was
                    superb. In the 2009 Champions League final, Barcelona were truly dominant against Manchester United. At this
                    time, United had Cristiano Ronaldo (in his final season before joining Real Madrid) who was considered the best
                    player in the world. Barcelona played the game without Abidal and Alves in defense. This resulted in Sylvinho
                    playing at left-back and Carlos Puyol playing at right-back (where he started his career). A third position was
                    also affected, as Toure played at center-back, with Sergio Busquets playing the defensive midfield role. These
                    defensive changes were against a strong United side, including the likes of Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez, Dimitar
                    Berbatov and Ronaldo in attack. Yet, in the game, Messi tore his opponents to shreds and scored a superb header
                    to help his side to victory. Ronaldo fed off scraps for most of the game. Most of his chances were shots which
                    never truly looked like they would trouble Victor Valdes in the Barcelona goal.

                    On the other hand, Barcelona thoroughly deserved to win the La Liga title. In the previous season, they had
                    finished 18 points behind Real Madrid, who were champions. One of this side’s most famous performances came at
                    the Bernabeu, in May of 2009, where they beat Madrid 6-2. Other notable victories included a 6-1 victory against
                    Atletico Madrid, and 4-0 victories over both Valencia and Sevilla. They were dominant in La Liga, defeating top
                    sides by huge margins.

                    Barcelona’s dominance continued through the next few seasons. While they failed to defend their Champions League
                    title (as is customary), they won a La Liga and Copa del Rey double in the 2009-2010 season. In the 2010-2011
                    season, they were back to their best, winning a La Liga and Champions League double. By this time, there were
                    some differences. The back four and goalkeeper stayed the same, but Busquets had overtaken Toure in the pecking
                    order to play behind Xavi and Iniesta in midfield. In the 2011 Champions League final, Busquets and Xavi
                    controlled the midfield. Sir Alex Ferguson could only praise the opposition after the final whistle, admitting
                    that United had been beaten by a better side.

                    Guardiola’s first season was the start of a special period for Barcelona. This side simply played teams off the
                    park. Possessing two of the most talented midfielders of this generation (and of all-time) in Xavi and Iniesta,
                    they controlled games in a way never seen before. Barcelona won the treble in style, earning the respect of
                    football fans all around the world.
